## **Problem**:

    Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## Understand:
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
---
    Input: head = [1,2]
    Output: [2,1]
---
    Input: head = []
    Output: []


## Match:
    - Dummy Head Technique
    - Pointer Bookkeeping

## Plan:


## Implement:
    

## Review:


## Evaluate:
    Time Complexity:
    - O(n)
      - Must traverse entire Linked List
    Space Complexity:
    - O(n)
      - Temp pointer created for every Node in List
